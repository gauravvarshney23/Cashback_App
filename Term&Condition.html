<p style="text-align: justify;">
Certain Affiliate Stores exclude a limited number of products and purchases from

the Programme. Yoneak Services Pvt. Ltd. does its best to minimize and

maintain an up-to- date list of exclusions on Yoneak Services Pvt. Ltd.. To start

earning cashback, you must complete your purchase during the same shopping

session you start after clicking on the Yoneak Services Pvt. Ltd. link. If you visit

other sites before completing your purchases or use coupons not provided by

Yoneak Services Pvt. Ltd., your purchases might be associated with a service

other than Yoneak Services Pvt. Ltd. and you might not earn cashback on your

purchase. If you disable ‘cookies’ on your computer, you will not be able to earn

cashback as cookies are used to authenticate the user and be certain cashback

is assigned to the Member account.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
After a Member successfully completes a Qualifying Transaction, and once we

have received the resulting Cashback for that Qualifying Transaction, we pass

that Cashback to the Member through his/her Cashback Receipt Method.

Please note that there are various circumstances in which a transaction with a

Retailer may not constitute a Qualifying Transaction, or Cashback may not result

from it. The Member understands that all transactions made by him/her are not

with us, but with the individual Retailer. Our help pages provide further

information about these circumstances. Further, from time to time Retailers may

increase or decrease the commission paid – in which case the cashback offer

illustrated on our Site may be incorrect. By default, your applicable transactions

will be credited in line with the commission reported to us by the Retailer, which

may be more or less than the advertised rate. We shall not be liable for any

difference in the expected cashback by the Member and the actual Cashback

received by the Member.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When we have traced a paying, Qualifying Transaction to your Account, we will

credit your Account with a &#39;pending payment&#39;. Once the Retailer confirms the

transaction, the payment will be marked as &#39;validated&#39; – this can take 90 days or

more from the date of the purchase. If the goods are returned or the sale

reversed or amended by any means then the cashback payment will not be

made. Further, in the event that the Retailer feels that the purchase is not

genuine for any reason whatsoever and we do not receive any Cashback for the

transaction, the Member will not receive any Cashback.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Whether a transaction shall qualify as a Qualifying for cashback Transaction shall

be at the sole discretion of the Retailer or us and the Member understands and

agrees to the same. We shall not be held responsible if the Retailer fails to report

a sale to us or does not qualify a transaction as Qualifying Transaction. Further,

we shall not be responsible in the event due to some technical or other error we

cannot trace a sale back to the Member and does not qualify the transaction as a

Qualifying Transaction for any reason whatsoever. Whilst we will endeavour to

recuperate non-payments from the Retailer, the decision of ourselves, the

Retailer or Retailer&#39;s tracking agent is final. Whilst we will try and recuperate

missing commissions, at any point we reserve the right not to chase missing

commission claims, particularly where no purchase has been made.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When a Member sends us an enquiry on missing cashback, our system would

check if the user had an exit click from our site for that store on the date

mentioned by the user. If no exit clicks can be tracked then we will show a

message to the Member indicating that they did not click via our website to earn

cashback prior to the sale. All exit clicks to stores are saved in the database for

cross reference on adding cashback values. Where a commission enquiry has

been successfully paid by a Retailer, you may receive a lower amount than

expected; this is due to the amounts received by ourselves possibly being lower

than the original claim. We do allow you to query this with us. If a Retailer still

hasn&#39;t paid a manual commission claim after a period of six months then we

reserve the right to close the enquiry claim.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
We reserve the right to reclaim or make balance adjustments accordingly where it

has been established that any credit has been applied in error. This will include

but is not limited to transactions where the credit is not genuinely due or payment

for any credited transaction has not been received from a Retailer or its agencies

and/or misuse or fraud. This can include transactions which are already marked

as payable or validated in your Account, or for transactions which have already

been paid over to you by [Cheque] or any other means.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
There are various circumstances in which Cashback will not be payable to the

Member, and will be forfeited to us, these could be, without limitation:

where the cashback payment that we receive is not attributed to a Qualifying

Transaction or associated with an Account (such as where the Member is not

logged-in to the our site when making the relevant purchase)the transaction to

which the Cashback relates is cancelled after it has been entered into (whether

under the right of cancellation that applies to some sales made at a distance, or

otherwise) the Cashback is attributed to a Member or Account that has been:

Suspended by us or for any other reason;

associated with any fraudulent activity or any breach of this Agreement;

Our help pages provide further information about these circumstances.

Retailer or to gain Cashback (a) by providing personal information of someone

else, or a payment method which they are not entitled to use, (b) by deceptively

or unfairly exploiting a Retailers offering including but not limited to creating fake

or unauthorized referral links, or (c) in breach of any terms and conditions applied

by us or the Retailer to that transaction. We reserve the right to forfeit any

pending payments or validated payments in the Member&#39;s Account in case of

such misuse of our service by the Member.

Service, or the entirety of it, where we have legal, security, technical or

commercial reasons to do so. We will endeavour to give you 30 days advance

notice before taking such action, except where it is necessary to take earlier

action for security reasons or because of technical difficulties which would

otherwise adversely affect the our service. There may also be times when the

Cashback Service becomes inaccessible as a result of technical difficulties

experienced by us or on the Internet; we will, however, use reasonable skill and

care to overcome these difficulties where they are within our control. Please note,

however, that we cannot guarantee continuous access to the Cashback Service
